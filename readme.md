Work in progress. 

Currently have a VPS up and running @ http://109.228.52.142/funding

I have been focusing on making it load quicker / supporting NonJS users.

Tutorials will come after:    
- the list can be edited while running
- view only wallets can be created automatically @ setup 
- [ ] secure deletion of hot wallet files
- [ ] wipe memory caches
- [x] monero view only wallet
- [ ] bch view only wallet
- [ ] btc view only wallet

I will then begin work on Pi / VPS tutorials to show how easily you can deploy a funding page(and make a real readme! (:)
