Work in progress. 

Currently have a VPS up and running @ http://109.228.52.142/funding

I have been focusing on making it load quicker / supporting NonJS users.

Tutorials will come after:    
- [x] the list can be edited while running
- [ ] view only wallets can be created automatically @ setup 
    - [x] monero
    - [ ] bch
    - [ ] btc 
- [x] secure deletion of hot wallet files
- [ ] wipe memory caches
- [ ] detect btc/bch addresses so non-modified wallets can be used
- [ ] update monero / bch / btc wallet files

I will then begin work on Pi / VPS tutorials to show how easily you can deploy a funding page(and make a real readme! (:)
